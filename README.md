# Rust example using private crates

A simple example of how to host and use a private crate of your own making in github. Uses [rust-simple-add-crate](https://github.com/razorfrost44/rust-simple-add-crate). Imports it to this project.

```toml
simple-add-crate = { version = "0.2.0", git = "https://github.com/razorfrost44/rust-simple-add-crate.git" }
```
